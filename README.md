# linked-lists
## The Odin Project: Linked Lists. 
### [Click here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists) to go to project instructions.

#### The following goes over the functions attahced to the Linked List class:
+ `console.log(mainList);` logs the linked list to the console.
+ `console.log(mainList.toString());` logs the linked list to the console in a list order; **this one is the easiest to read/make sense of the list**.
+ `append(value)` adds a new node containing `value` to the end of the list.
+ `prepend(value)` adds a new node containing `value` to the start of the list.
+ `size()` returns the total number of nodes in the list.
+ `firstNode()` size returns the total number of nodes in the list.
+ `tail()` returns the last node in the list.
+ `at(index)` returns the node at the given `index`.
+ `pop()` removes the last element from the list.
+ `contains(value)` returns true if the passed `value` is in the list and otherwise returns *false*.
+ `find(value)` returns the index of the node containing `value`, or *null* if not found.
+ `toStringList()` represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console.
+ `toString()` represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console as a **easy to read** list, in list format.
+ `insertAt(value, index)` inserts a new node with the provided `value` at the given `index`.
+ `removeAt(index)` removes the node at the given `index`.
+ `clear()` clears/removes the entire list.
